            Coronavirus disease is an unprecedented biological threat that affects our survival and has put an unanticipated amount of stress on the socioeconomic institutions throughout the globe.
            WHO and country relevant agencies have been issuing advisories and strict quarantine counter measures have been mounted to check transmission and prevent the spread.
          </p>

          <h2>Things to Do Frequently</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Wash your hands frequently</strong>
            <br>
            Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
            Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Maintain social distancing</strong>
            <br>
            Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
            Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. 
            If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</strong>
            <br>
            Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. 
            From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
          </p>

          <p>
           <strong>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early</strong>
          <br>
          Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
          Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area.
          Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider</strong>
            <br>
            Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.
            Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading in your area. 
            They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            WHO has done a tremendous job of updating situation reports, circulating myth-busters and countering claims with evidence that should be used as yardstick of prevention against the newly emerged COVID-19 threat.
            Similarly, government agencies across the nation states have their own action plan – authenticated sources and actual intelligence is key to prevention and mitigates panic that can spread and cause problems.
            Of the scale that all of us are reading about such as hoarding of essential items (hand sanitizers, food surplus and even toilet paper in some countries).
          </p>
          <p>
            Your concern implemented as precautions and preventive care based on proper advice will make a huge difference to not only our own lives but to the lives of others as well.
            Help those who may not understand the full extent of this serious disease, such as socially and economically marginalised strata of society with whom you are in contact. 
            This would in turn strengthen the overall disease fighting resilience towards which all the nations are striving to progress towards.
          </p>

            Vaccines must be proven to be safe and effective before they are given to people. The COVID-19 vaccines are no different. 
            These vaccines are being proven safe every day, as hundreds of thousands of Coloradans -– doctors, nurses, seniors, and others -– have already taken them. 
            Nationally, many millions of people have also received the vaccine.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why should I consider getting vaccinated?</strong>
            <br>
            To help protect people from getting COVID-19.
            Getting the COVID-19 vaccine is an effective way to stop people from getting really sick or dying from COVID-19. 
            Being vaccinated means that you are protected from getting seriously ill.
            It may also reduce the chance that you could spread COVID-19 to others who are more vulnerable.
